"""
Node-wide maintenance-mode gate (design doc §13.8): once activated, new connections are refused before
login even begins (see `netbbs.net.login_flow.handle_session`) — the
piece a deliberate shutdown sequence needs to stop admitting new users
while it broadcasts a warning and disconnects everyone already
connected. Deliberately its own tiny module, not folded into
`netbbs.net.session_registry`: gating *new* connections and tracking
*existing* ones are related but distinct concerns.

**Lockdown** (design doc §13.8) is a second, independent gate added to
this same class: a SysOp-toggleable `[M]aintenance mode` that blocks
new *non-SysOp* logins only, checked *after* credentials verify (so a
SysOp can still reach the menu that turns it back off), and reversible
-- unlike `activate()`/`is_active()` above, which is shutdown's
one-way, unconditional, pre-login gate with no bypass and no way back
*once a shutdown actually reaches its disconnect step*, since the whole
node is going away regardless of who's asking. Deliberately named and
checked differently rather than sharing one flag: the two answer
genuinely different questions ("is this node about to disappear" vs.
"should ordinary users be kept out for now"), and conflating them would
either weaken shutdown's hard guarantee or deny a SysOp their own
reason for toggling maintenance mode on in the first place.

`deactivate()` (design doc -- node management) is the one exception to
`activate()`'s "no way back" framing above: a *scheduled* graceful
shutdown now has a countdown a SysOp can cancel before it fires
(`netbbs.net.shutdown.SequenceScheduler`) -- if they do, new-login
admission must reopen too, or a cancelled shutdown would leave the node
silently unreachable forever. Once a shutdown has actually reached
`disconnect_all()`, there is no calling `deactivate()` anymore,
matching the rest of this docstring's claim exactly for that point
onward.

Issue #107 adds one narrow ownership rule to that reversible window.
Each `activate()` remembers the asyncio task which most recently claimed
the hard shutdown gate. A cancelled *older* shutdown task may therefore
only reopen admission if it still owns that gate; if a replacement
shutdown has already activated, the stale task's cleanup is ignored.
The explicit SysOp cancel path remains valid because it first requests
cancellation of the owning shutdown task and then calls `deactivate()`
from the admin-session task -- an external caller may release the gate
once its owner is already cancelling.
